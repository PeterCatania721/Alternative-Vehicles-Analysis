Credits for EVs and PHEVs in Category 1 are equal to the actual cost
incurred to purchase or lease the vehicle, multiplied by the battery
capacity, and divided by 100. That amount must be multiplied by a factor
to determine the credit amount, as follows: 1.0 for 2014-2018, 0.75 for
2019, 0.50 for 2020, and 0.25 for 2021.

Annual credit caps exist for each technology type and vehicle weight
class, and for cumulative annual credits. A person who claimed a tax
credit in previous years for the purchase or lease of Model Year 2004
and newer HEV may claim an additional credit for the conversion of the
same vehicle to a PHEV. The purchase of a used vehicle may qualify if
the vehicle was not previously registered in Colorado. Credits may not
be carried forward and a taxpayer will receive a refund for the excess
credit.

Credits for vehicles purchased, leased, or converted during the 2014 tax
year may be determined in one of two different ways. For more

6294,KY,Alternative Fuel Production Tax Incentives,"Through the Incentives for Energy Independence Act program, the Kentucky
Economic Development Finance Authority (KEDFA) provides tax incentives
to construct, retrofit, or upgrade an alternative fuel production or
gasification facility that uses coal or biomass as a feedstock. KEDFA
also provides tax incentives for energy-efficient alternative fuel
production facilities and for up to five alternative fuel production
facilities that use natural gas or natural gas liquids as a feedstock.
Energy-efficient alternative fuels are defined as homogeneous fuels that
are produced from processes designed to densify feedstocks such as coal,
waste coal, or biomass resources and have an energy content that is
greater than the feedstock. The incentives may consist of: 1) a refund
of up to 100% of the state sales tax paid on the purchase of personal
property used to construct, retrofit, or upgrade the facility; 2) a
credit of up to 100% of an approved company\'s state income tax and
limited liability entity tax that the project generates; 3) up to 4% of
the wage assessment of employees whose jobs were created as a result of
the construction, retrofit, upgrade, or operation of a qualified
facility; and 4) a credit for up to 80% of the severance tax paid for
coal, natural gas, or natural gas liquids used as a feedstock. KEDFA may
allow advance incentive disbursement to encourage the use of in-state
labor for facility construction.

The incentives expire at the time of receipt of the authorized amount or
25 years from activation of the project, whichever occurs first.
Approved companies may recover up to 50% of their capital investment via
the authorized tax incentives. The minimum capital investment for
incentive eligibility is \$25 million for an alternative fuel or
gasification facility that uses biomass as the primary feedstock; \$100
million for an alternative fuel or gasification facility that uses coal,
oil shale, or tar sands as the primary feedstock; \$25 million for an
energy-efficient alternative fuel facility; and \$1 million for a
facility that uses natural gas or natural gas liquids as the primary
feedstock.

To apply for the incentive, an eligible taxpayer must submit a \$1,000
non-refundable application fee and remit payment for any other fees in
connection with the project, including administrative, legal, and
consulting fees. For more information, see the [Kentucky Business
Incentives and Financial
Programs](http://www.thinkkentucky.com/Locating_Expanding/Financial_Incentives.aspx)

* Requires no more than 50% of the water required to grow corn.
* Is tolerant to high temperatures and waterlogging.
* Is resistant to drought and saline-alkaline soils.
* Is capable of being grown in marginal soils, ranging from heavy
clay to light sand.
* Requires no more than one-third of the nitrogen required to
grow corn.
* Requires no more than one-half of the energy necessary to
convert corn into ethanol.

* Development of a small advanced ethanol manufacturing facility
network, which reduces the feedstock supply risk, does not burden
local water supplies, and provides for a more broad-based
economic development.
* Expansion of advanced ethanol supply and demand beyond the 10%
blend market by blending ethanol with gasoline at the gas station
pump. Blender pumps, directly installed and operated at local gas
stations by a qualified small advanced ethanol manufacturing

payment. The pass-through option is also available to a project owner
with an Oregon tax liability who chooses to transfer his or her tax
credit. The ODOE must grant preliminary and final certification for a
project to be eligible. The taxpayer must have filed an application for
the project before April 15, 2011, and ODOE must have granted
preliminary certification for the project by July 1, 2011. Projects that

retroactively extended through December 31, 2014 by [Public

A tax credit of \$0.50 per gallon is available for liquefied hydrogen
that is sold for use or used as a fuel to operate a motor vehicle. For
an entity to be eligible to claim the credit they must be liable for
reporting and paying the federal excise tax on the sale or use of the
fuel in a motor vehicle. Tax exempt entities such as state and local
governments that dispense qualified fuel from an on-site fueling station
for use in vehicles qualify for the incentive. Eligible entities must be
registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The incentive must
first be taken as a credit against the entity\'s alternative fuel tax
liability; any excess over this fuel tax liability may be claimed as a
direct payment from the IRS. Under current law, the credit for liquefied
hydrogen expires after December 31, 2014. For more information about
claiming the credit, see [IRS Publication

Qualified fuels include electricity, ethanol, and biodiesel from
renewable sources. Eligible costs are those directly related to the
project, including equipment cost, engineering and design fees,
materials, supplies, and installation costs.

An eligible applicant (a project owner) must meet the following
requirements:

-   Be a trade, business, or rental property owner with a business site
    in Oregon or be an Oregon non-profit organization, tribe, or public
    entity that partners with an Oregon business or resident;
-   Own or be the contract buyer of the project; and

Non-profit organizations and public entities that do not have an Oregon
tax liability may receive the credit for an eligible project but must
\""pass-through\"" or transfer their project eligibility to a pass-through
partner in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment. The Oregon Department
of Energy (ODOE) determines the rate that is used to calculate the cash
payment. The pass-through option is also available to a project owner
with an Oregon tax liability who chooses to transfer their tax credit.
ODOE must grant preliminary and final certification for a project to be
eligible. The taxpayer must have filed an application for the project
before April 15, 2011, and ODOE must have granted preliminary
certification for the project by July 1, 2011. Projects that began prior
to April 15, 2011, must receive final certification by July 1, 2014.

guidance to local governments on how to reduce GHG emissions. In the
Portland metropolitan area, land use and transportation scenario
planning to meet these targets is required. These activities are
encouraged in the other areas.
